                "a1": "No! That's the beauty of it. Mini Apps are purely client-side code (HTML/JS) that communicate directly with other users via the Ixian P2P network. No backend infrastructure is required.",
                "q2": "Are Mini Apps secure?",
                "a2": "Extremely. They run in a sandboxed environment (WebView) and all network traffic is encrypted using Ixian's post-quantum secure protocol (RSA + ECDH + ML-KEM). The app itself cannot access your sensitive data without permission.",
                "q3": "How do I install a Mini App?",
                "a3": "You don't need to 'install' strictly speaking. You can add them from a repository or simply receive a .spixi file in a chat. They load instantly. You can pin your favorites for easy access.",
                "q4": "Can I build my own?",
                "a4": "Absolutely. If you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can build a Mini App. We provide a simple SDK to handle the P2P communication. Check the 'Build' section for guides.",
                "q5": "What can Mini Apps do?",
                "a5": "Almost anything a web app can do! Games, calculators, collaborative tools, polls, and even controlling IoT devices via gateways. The limit is your imagination.",
                "q6": "Does it cost money?",
                "a6": "Building and hosting Mini Apps is free because there are no servers to pay for. Users also don't pay gas fees for standard interactions.",
                "q7": "How do I update an app?",
                "a7": "Developers release new versions as .spixi files. When you open a newer version, Spixi automatically updates your local cache.",
                "q8": "Can Mini Apps make payments?",
                "a8": "Yes, they can request payments (in IXI) which the user must approve in the native Spixi interface. Secure and simple.",
                "q9": "What about offline usage?",
                "a9": "Since the app code is cached locally, many apps (like calculators or solo games) work perfectly offline. Network features will resume when you reconnect.",
                "q10": "Is there an App Store?",
                "a10": "We have a community directory where you can browse featured apps, but anyone can distribute an app directly to users without a gatekeeper."
